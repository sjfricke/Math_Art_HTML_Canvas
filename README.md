# Math Art - With HTML Canvas

This was inspired to do for my Digital Art and Code course. I wanted to combine beautiful math equations with web graphical programming to create 2D art. I refrained from 3D art as 2D art has its own unique features and reduces a degree of complexity.

## Lorenz System

The [Lorenze System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system) is a system of ordinary differential equations first studied by Edward Lorenz. It is notable for having chaotic solutions for certain parameter values and initial conditions.

## Gingerbreadman Map

The [Gingerbreadman Map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingerbreadman_map) is a "chaotic two-dimensional symmetric map". It is given by the piecewise linear transformation.

## DotMaker

There is a part two to this project, but when asked to pushed my canvas to 10,000 balls I had to stop so others could crash their browser as well. The constants are set in top of `main.js`
